Current Interactive Campus Map at RPI:
http://rpi.edu/tour/zoomify/

This map is very confusing and hard to use, but it does zoom in.
I am hoping to use the map picture and have a searching function for buildings.
When you select a building, it will change colors on the map.
I would like to implement classroom searching as well.

East Tennesse State University publishes all of their classrooms: http://www.etsu.edu/oit/special/multimedia.aspx
I am hoping to find something similar to this for RPI.

# campusmap

The project I would like to work on in this course is creating a more interactive campus map with data about locations of classrooms and lecture halls. By either making or using a databse in PostgreSQL or SQL of all the classrooms at RPI and what floor they are on (maybe in reference from the entry floor). The users of my app will be RPI students, specifically freshmen and who need to learn where classrooms on campus are and upperclassmen at the beginning of the semester. I will use the MIT license because I want to give permission to others to collaborate with me on this project.

# campusmap
## Samm Katcher and Aaron Taylor


The project we worked on in this course is creating a more interactive campus map with data about locations of classrooms and lecture halls.
By either making or using a databse in JSON of all the important locations of places on campus at RPI, we have made a fresh and modern update for map.rpi.edu. We would like to have this launched on the site in the future.
The users of my app will be RPI students, specifically freshmen and who need to learn where classrooms on campus are and upperclassmen at the beginning of the semester.

We included text files of all of the band and forth emails we had with YACS and Professor Peter Fox for future developers if they would like to integrate this into YACS or map.rpi.edu.

We used use the MIT license because we want to give permission to others to collaborate with us on this project.

### New Tools
Neither of us were familiar with using the Google Maps API. We both got fairly proficient at using this API, and how API permissions work in general. I also think that getting proficient at using Github and branching/ merging was a huge skill I developed during this project. - Samm

## Goals Changed
Our goal had changed on this project midway through. It was very difficult to get source code for this map because it was effectively lost somewhere in the RPI servers. When we got the source code, it was a complete mess. The buildings were dynamically created variables within the map instead of being in a static database. So, a large portion of the work we did for this project was finding the source code and creating a JSON database of all of the buildings on campus.
We knew we wanted to make a fresh interface for this map, so that goal did not change. But, the goal of having classroom markers became unfeasable, so we linked floor plans of buildings instead. I think that's a great jumping off point for the future of the project but addng it was important to us for the scope of this class project.
